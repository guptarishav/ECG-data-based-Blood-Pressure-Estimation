# ECG-data-based-Blood-Pressure-Estimation
Our prime objective in this project is to estimate Blood Pressure (BP), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), values based on Electrocardiograph (ECG) data. We must classify the blood pressure reading into three groups (Normal, Prehypertension, and Hypertension) using the SBP and DBP values
